    <p>"Ode To A Small Lump Of Green Putty I Found In My Armpit One Midsummer Morning" is a poem by Grunthos the Flatulent. During a reading of the poem, 4 of his audience died of internal hemorrhaging and the president of the Mid-Galactic Arts Nobbling Council survived by gnawing one of his own legs off. Grunthos was reported to have been "disappointed" by the poem's reception.  </p>
